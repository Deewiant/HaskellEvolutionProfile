HaskellEvolutionProfile
=======================

Profiling ["Evolution of a Haskell Programmer"](http://www.willamette.edu/~fruehr/haskell/evolution.html)

I Had issues compiling the examples for

* Static
* BeginningGraduate
* Origamist
* PHD
* PostDoc
* TenuredProfessor

... so these have been excluded for the present.

The memoizing solution seems to be the clear winner at this point, with the list-encoding solution being the clear loser:
